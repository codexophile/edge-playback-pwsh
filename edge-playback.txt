Why does the dragon demand a sacrifice of three daughters once every generation if she had only one clutch of three hatchlings that were killed? Considering how the dragon is implied to be centuries if not millennia old, it's possible that her perception of time is different than a human's or that she sees a human's lifespan as insignificant compared to a dragon's. Her daughters would've lived for hundreds or thousands of years, but they were murdered by beings who live for a relatively meager 90.
On the surface it might seem strange that a dynasty as ruthless as the Aurean royal family would go through all the hassle of procuring foreign brides at great expense in bride prices to be sacrificed instead of just rounding up local peasant girls, considering that the ritual doesn't even require the marriage to be consummated. Closer examination shows this to be more of their Pragmatic Villainy?????? at play: sacrificing peasant girls might save them a lot of gold, but in the long run it risks either the commons deciding to revolt or worse… ratting them out to the dragon. The movie itself shows that the island's commoners are perfectly capable of going in and out of the mountain if properly motivated.
Fridge Logic??????
Logically, since the woman Elodie sees at the palace is another bride sacrifice, the prince she marries should already have a cut on his palm from the last wedding.
Maybe the royal family knows about the gloworms. It would be an additional source of wealth.
